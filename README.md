# UMass-Course-Visualizer
This is a WIP project by Shamanth Kuthpadi and Quang Dang on creating a ratemyprofessor-like web application with an interactive graph of CICS courses at UMass Amherst. This is inspired by the idea of topologically sorting an ordering of vertices (in this case courses) learned in COMPSCI 311.

## How to run - for now
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the server
4. Go to `localhost:3000` to view the web application
